"""Project VocalEyes — long-blink selection for people with advanced ALS.

A single-file, on-device eye-tracking module. A webcam frame is passed
through MediaPipe Face Mesh, the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) of each eye is
measured, and a sustained bilateral eye closure is turned into one
deliberate action: a **Long Blink / Select**.
